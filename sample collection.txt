Independent Variables:
1. Patient ID = ID Given to the patient on booking the test

2. Agent ID = ID of the agent assigned to pick the sample

3. Pincode = Patient area Pincode, where the sample must be collected

4. patient location = Area of the patient

5. Latitudes and Longitudes (Patient) = Location of the patient in Latitudes and Longitudes

6. Latitudes and Longitudes (Agent) = Location of the Agent in Latitudes and Longitudes

7. Latitudes and Longitudes (Diagnostic Center) = Location of the Diagnostic Center in Latitudes and Longitudes

8. Diagnostic Centers = Name of the diagnostic center where the sample must be delivered

10. Time slot = The time slot in which the patient can book the sample pickup

11. shortest distance Agent-Pathlab(m) = The shortest distance between agent and pathology lab
 
12. shortest distance Patient-Pathlab(m) = The shortest distance between patient and pathology lab

13. shortest distance Patient-Agent(m) = Shortest distance between patient and agent

14. Availability time (Patient) = Patient availability for sample collection 

15. Age = Age of the patient

16. Gender = Gender of the patient

17. Test Booking Date = The date on which the test was booked

18. Test Booking Time HH:MM = The time at which the test was booked

19. Test name = Name of the test booked

20. Sample = The kind of sample to be collected for that particular test booked

21. Way Of Storage Of Sample = How the sample is stored

22. Sample Collection Date = The date on which the patient asked the sample to be collected

23. Time For Sample Collection MM = Time taken for sample collection

24. Time Agent-Pathlab sec = Time taken in seconds for the agent to reach the pathology lab from agent current location

25. Agent Arrival Time (range) HH:MM = Time at which agent might arrive at patient's place
				for this column we use  "Availability time (Patient)" and
                         in this column we consider time interval of 1hr i.e. 60mins
				and in that we take approx ci = 83% , alpha = 10
				by that range will decrease to 50min(approx) required
                         column

26. Exact Arrival Time MM = Exact time at which the agent will arrive at patient's place at there availability time
				again we take ci = 87%
				sd = 1.5
				alpha = 6
				new range = 50-6 = 44mins
then we apply following logic,
	x = shortest distance Patient-Agent(m)		
    if x is < 500:
        return 44-20
    elif x is < 500 and > 1000:
        return 44-10
    elif x is > 1000 < 5000:
        return 44-5
    elif x is > 5000 and < 10000:
        return 44+5
    elif x is > 10000 and < 15000:
        return 44+10
    else:   #x>15000
        44+20

notice in our dataset inside x column we have few values which is grether than 68km n for that we will get Exact Arrival Time MM > Agent Arrival Time (range) HH:MM..
